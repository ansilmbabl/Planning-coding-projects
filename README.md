Detailed explanation of each of the 9 steps for planning coding projects, based on the points and examples shared in the Tech With Tim video[1]:

## 1. Define Your Goal
- Get very clear about:
  - *Why* you’re making the project (fun, business, portfolio, etc.).
  - *Who* the project is for (yourself, a client, a specific audience).
  - *What* will make it valuable (what problem does it solve?).
- Tim emphasizes that skipping this leads to directionless projects. Your goal affects every decision later: tech stack, features, code style, etc. Write these answers down for reference.

## 2. Write User Stories
- List what users should be able to do with your app (e.g., “User can upload a file,” “User can create an account”).
- Keep it simple and non-technical at this stage. Focus on user actions, not implementation details.
- This ensures you’re building features that matter to users, not just what seems cool or interesting.

## 3. Define Data Models
- Think about all the types of data your app needs (users, posts, comments, etc.).
- Sketch out relationships and required fields for each data type, but stay high-level.
- This step helps you catch missing data or relationships before you start coding, saving you from major refactoring later.

## 4. Nail Down the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Ruthlessly cut features to the bare minimum needed for the app to function and provide value.
- Ask, “Do I absolutely need this for the app to work?” If not, cut it.
- For example, a task app MVP might only allow creating, completing, and deleting tasks—no categories or collaboration yet.
- This step prevents scope creep and keeps the project manageable.

## 5. Draw a Simple Prototype or Wireframe
- Sketch a basic layout of your app on paper or digitally.
- Visualize user flow: where forms go, what happens after actions, how navigation works.
- This helps catch UX issues early and ensures you have a clear picture before coding.
- Remember: “Paper is cheap, code is expensive”—fix mistakes now, not later.

## 6. Consider the Project’s Future
- Decide if this is a quick prototype, a scalable product, or something long-term.
- Think about how long you’ll maintain it and how real users will interact with it.
- This affects your technical decisions and how much flexibility or scalability you build in.

## 7. Identify Core Components & Architecture
- Determine what kind of app you’re building: script, web app, mobile app, browser extension, etc.
- Decide if you need a backend, frontend, database, or other components.
- Map out the high-level architecture to avoid rebuilding things later.
- For example, a simple script might just be a Python file, while a social media app needs backend, frontend, and database.

## 8. Pick Your Tech Stack
- Only choose technologies after you’ve planned the project.
- Select the simplest stack that fits your skills and project needs.
- Avoid picking tools first and forcing your project to fit them.
- Make sure you can actually deploy your chosen stack, and don’t add unnecessary complexity unless learning is a goal.
- Stick with tools you know unless the project is meant for learning.

## 9. Create a Roadmap & Start Building
- Break the project into actionable tasks and set milestones.
- Start by creating a project skeleton (folders, version control).
- Set up the database and data models first, then backend routes, then frontend.
- Test as you go, deploy early and often, and iterate by adding features gradually.
- Add automated deployment/testing if needed, and always prefer small, tested increments over building everything at once.

**Summary:**  
This process ensures you have a clear vision, avoid wasted effort, and build projects that actually solve user needs. Tim stresses that planning saves more time than it costs and helps you ship projects faster, with fewer headaches[1].
